As a Software Engineering Manager, I've stepped away from coding on the daily due to the more pressing needs of the team. Now that we're in a different season, I'm working through some old courses to help me brush up on my skills. First up, starting with Wes Bos' JavaScript30. I'll be sharing some takeaways here.
